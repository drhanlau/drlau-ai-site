Many people want to learn Vibe Coding but either:

1. Don't know the name of the design style they want, or
2. Don't know how to prompt the AI to get it.

It's like you have a superpower but you don't know the magic words.

You see a sick website and think, "I want that feeling."

But when you go to an AI tool, you type in "a cool website for my company" and get back something that looks like it was designed by a committee in 2015.

Generic. Boring. Forgettable.

So, what's the solution?

I have created a guide "8 Vibe Coding Styles Everyone is Stealing in 2026."

![8 Vibe Coding Styles Everyone Is Stealing in 2026]({{ '/assets/images/vibe-coding-cover.png' | relative_url }})

It's a simple plug-and-play book that names the styles (like Glassmorphism & Retro Nostalgia), and all you need to do is insert your industry or what you are doing (e.g. selling a ticket event, home page for a kindy, etc.)

In 2026, AI will build everything. Your only competitive advantage is taste. Luckily, that's something we can learn.

Go steal these styles and build something awesome.

## How to Use This Guide

The concept is dead simple.

The title on top indicates the style. All you have to do is describe your industry and indicate the style you want for your website or landing page.

**Format:** Please build a landing page for a {your company / industry}, using the {style}.

**Prompt example:** Please build a landing page for a digital marketing agency, using the glassmorphism style.

AI will then generate the web page according to your prompt.
