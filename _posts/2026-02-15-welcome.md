Welcome to my new blog! I'm Dr. Lau Cher Han, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on artificial intelligence, machine learning, education, and the evolving technology landscape.

## What to Expect

Over the coming weeks and months, I plan to write about:

- **AI in Southeast Asia** — the opportunities and challenges unique to our region
- **Machine Learning in Practice** — real-world applications beyond the hype
- **Education & Upskilling** — preparing the workforce for an AI-powered future
- **Industry Insights** — lessons from working with enterprises like IKEA, Intel, IBM, and more

## Why Now?

After 15+ years in the AI and technology space, I've accumulated insights from academia, consulting, and entrepreneurship that I believe are worth sharing more broadly. Whether you're a student, a developer, a business leader, or simply curious about AI, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if there's a topic you'd like me to cover.
